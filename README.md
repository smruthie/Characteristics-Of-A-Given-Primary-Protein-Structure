# Computing Characteristics of Primary Protein Structure

The programs in this repository calculate the fundamental chemical characteristics of a user-inputted protein sequence: acidic, basic, hydrophobic, and hydrophilic residues; protein charges and isoelectric point at a net charge of zero. The pKa values of amino acids need to be verified with additional sources; updates will be made accordingly.

One of the pursuits of bioinformatics and computational biology is being able to get abundant information about a protein from its amino acid sequence, currently the highest goal being its tertiary structure. With further research and review, I'll add algorithms to obtain more chemical/biological attributes and structures from an amino acid sequence. Currently, the algorithms in this repository just serve as a starting point.
