# Computing Chemical Characteristics of Primary Protein Structure

The programs in this repository calculate the fundamental chemical characteristics of a user-inputted protein sequence: acidic, basic, hydrophobic, and hydrophilic residues. One takes the sequence typed by the user, and another accepts a user-inputted sequence file to calculate protein charges and isoelectric point (when net charge = 0). I need to verify the pKa values of amino acids with other sources as well and make updates accordingly.
