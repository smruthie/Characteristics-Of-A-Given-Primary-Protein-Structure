# Computing Chemical Characteristics of Primary Protein Structure

Protein Sequence Content.py: Calculates the amount of acidic, basic, polar, non-polar, hydrophobic, and hydrophilic residues in a peptide sequence entered by the user. 

protein charge and pI.py: Calculates the protein charge based on user-inputted protein sequence file, and also the pI if the net charge of the protein is zero.
