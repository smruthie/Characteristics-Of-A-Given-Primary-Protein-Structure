# Computing Chemical Characteristics of Primary Protein Structure

The programs in this repository calculate the fundamental chemical characteristics of a user-inputted protein sequence: acidic, basic, hydrophobic, and hydrophilic residues. The first program takes the sequence typed by the user, and another accepts a user-inputted sequence file to calculate protein charges and isoelectric point (when net charge = 0). I need to verify the pKa values of amino acids with other sources as well and will make updates accordingly.

One of the pursuits of bioinformatics and computational biology is to be able to get the most information about a protein from its amino acid sequence, currently the highest goal being its tertiary structure. These programs include the most fundamental characteristics that could be obtained from an amino acid sequence. With further research and review, I'll add more algorithms to obtain more chemical/biological attributes and structures from an amino acid sequence.
